bio: |
  I am a first-year PhD student at Peking University, where my research focuses on **generative evaluation** and **agentic reasoning—specifically long-horizon planning and strategic decision-making in open-ended environments.** My academic path began early; I was admitted to the Wu Jianxiong School (Gifted Class) at Southeast University at the age of 15. I later completed my Master’s at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), serving as the Student Union President.

  Before returning to academia, I spent over four years as a Deep Learning Researcher in the industry. At Baidu’s Autonomous Driving Unit, I led the development of retrieval-based trajectory planning and self-supervised pre-training frameworks, which significantly enhanced vehicle safety and intent recall in complex urban scenarios. My tenure at Lenovo AI Lab focused on AutoML and meta-learning, where I developed decoupled neural architecture search (DNAS) algorithms. My recent work, including a spotlight paper at ICML 2025, focuses on building robust evaluation frameworks for open-ended agents, bridging the gap between large-scale generative models and reliable, autonomous reasoning.
