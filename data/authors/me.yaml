bio: |
  I am a first-year PhD student at Peking University researching generative evaluation and agentic reasoning within open-ended environments. My academic journey began at age 15 in the Wu Jianxiong Honor College at Southeast University, followed by a Master’s from UCAS, where I served as Student Union President. Prior to returning to academia, I spent four years as a Deep Learning Researcher at Baidu’s Autonomous Driving Department, leading the development of retrieval-based planning and self-supervised frameworks. My latest research, MCU (ICML 2025 Spotlight), establishes generative evaluation frameworks to advance autonomous agents in open-ended domains.
